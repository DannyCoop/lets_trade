    - Create a survivor class that will be players/NPCs
    survivor
    - name
    - inventory
    - status
    
    - Craete a store class that the user can interact with to buy from the NPCs
    room
    - name
    - type
    - player_list

    - Create the item class 
    item
    - name
    - flavor text

- next steps 
    - hook up to data base so the players invetories can be kept and store
    - Hook up to web sockets so you can trade with friends



Logic we want
- The ablility for a player survivor to enter a room
 - Do we want this method to be on the survivor or the room
 - I think this would be more genarual game logic not 

- display invetories
- add to inventory
